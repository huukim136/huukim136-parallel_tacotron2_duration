# parallel_tacotron2_duration
This is an unofficial implementation of the duration predictor and learned upsampling modules of Parallel Tacotron 2 paper.
The architecture of the convolution block is different with the one mentioned in the paper.
Also, here, the log scale of duration is utilized instead of normal scale as in the original paper.
